- Hive
  - `DataFrame.printSchema`:print the schema to parse
  - `java.lang.NullPointerException`:`select * from table where col is not null`
- Spark
  - `akka.frameSize`:increase the frameSize or change to the **broadcast** type
- Iterators
  - In contrast to Spark transformations,iterator transformations are executed linearly, one element at a time,rather than in parallel.This makes iterators slower but much easier to use if they could be executed in parallel.
