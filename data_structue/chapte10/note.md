## Map and HashTable
### Maps 
Python's **dict** class is arguably the most significant data structure in the language.It represents an abstraction known as **dictionary** in which **keys** are mapped to associated **values**.Because of the relationship they express between keys and values,dictionaries are known as **associative arrays or maps**
## Hash Table
1. hash codes in Python
Only *immutable* data types are deemed hashable in Python.This restriction is meant to ensure that a particular object's hash code remains constant during that object's lifespan.
2. Sets,Multi-sets,and Multimaps
- A set is an unordered collection of elements,without duplicates ,that typically supports efficient membership tests.
- A multi-set(also known as a **bag**) is a set-like container that allows duplicates
- A multi-map is similar to a traditional map,in that it associates values with keys;however,in a multi-map the same key can be mapped to multiple values.
