1. You are in a room with 3 switches which correspond to  3 bulbs in another room and you don't know which switch corresponds to which bulb. You can only enter the room with the bulbs once. You can NOT use any external equipment (power supplies, resistors, etc.). How do you find out which bulb corresponds to which switch?

      Turn on 2 switches.
      Turn one switch off after a few minutes.

      Enter room with bulbs.
      The bulb that is on is the only switch that is on.
      The bulb that is off but hot, is the switch that has been turned off.
      The bulb that is off and cold is the third switch.
