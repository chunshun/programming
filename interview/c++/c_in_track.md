1. In C, functions can return any type except arrays and functions. We can get around this limitation by returning pointer to array or pointer to function.
2. Concurrency in C++
    - parallel execution
      - In `<execution>`:  
        - `seq`:sequential execution
        - `par`:parallel execution
        - `par_unseq`:parallel and/or un-sequenced(vectorized) execution
    - parallel algorithms(In `<numeric>`)
      - such as `reduce(par_unseq,v.begin(),v.end())`
    - Use `scoped_lock` to manage `mutex`
    - Use `scoped_lock` to acquire multiple locks.
    - Use `shared_lock` to implement reader_write locks.
    - Use `condition_variable` to manage communications among `threads`
    - Use `unique_lock`(rather than `scoped_lock`) when you need to copy a lock or need lower-level manipulations of synchronization;
    - Use `unique_lock` rather than `scoped_lock` with `condition_variable`
    - Think in terms of tasks that can be executed concurrently,rather than directly in terms of `threads`;
    - Prefer `packaged_task` and `future` over direct use of `thread` and `mutex`;
    - Returning a result using a `promise` and get a result from a `future`;
    - Use `packaged_task` to handle exception thrown by tasks and arrange for value return;
    - Use a `packaged_task` and a `future` to express a request to an external service and wait for its response;
    - Use `async` to launch simple tasks;
